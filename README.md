#  Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability-Analysis

## **📌 Problem Statement**
Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis is a comprehensive evaluation aimed at understanding and optimizing the financial dynamics of a food delivery operation. The goal is to identify areas where the service can reduce costs, increase revenue, and implement pricing or commission strategies that enhance profitability.

## **🎯 Project Objectives**
1. Cost Analysis: Identify major cost components, including direct and indirect costs.
2. Profitability Evaluation: Assess individual and overall profitability by examining commission fees vs. total costs.
3. Strategic Recommendations: Propose strategies to reduce costs and optimize commission/discount rates for improved profitability.
4. Impact Simulation: Forecast the financial impact of recommended strategies and how they could transform losses into profits.

## **🔍 Key Insights**
Operations running at a loss: costs (2,32,709.85) exceed revenue (1,26,990), net loss of 1,05,719.85.

Costs are nearly double revenue, negative profit of -1,05,719.85.

Discounts are the major cost (74.9%).

Payment processing fees (12.8%) and delivery fees (12.3%) make up the remaining ~25%.

Profit distribution skewed towards losses; average profit per order is -200 (unprofitable).

Simulation with 30% commission and 6% discount shifts profitability towards positive values.

Recommended rates could increase profitable orders and improve financial health.
