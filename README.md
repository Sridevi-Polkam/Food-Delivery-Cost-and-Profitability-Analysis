#  Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability-Analysis

## **üìå Problem Statement**
Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis is a comprehensive evaluation aimed at understanding and optimizing the financial dynamics of a food delivery operation. The goal is to identify areas where the service can reduce costs, increase revenue, and implement pricing or commission strategies that enhance profitability.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains comprehensive details on Food orders:
‚û¢ Order ID: Unique identifier for each order
‚û¢ Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
‚û¢ Restaurant ID: Unique identifier for each restaurant
‚û¢ Order Date and Time: Date and time when the order was placed
‚û¢ Delivery Date and Time: Date and time when the delivery was made
‚û¢ Order Value: Total value of the order
‚û¢ Delivery Fee: Fee associated with the delivery
‚û¢ Payment Method: The method used for payment (e.g., Credit Card, Digital Wallet, Cash on Delivery).
‚û¢ Discounts and Offers: Any discounts or offers applied to the order
‚û¢ Commission Fee: Fee charged as a commission
‚û¢ Payment Processing Fee: The fee associated with processing the payment
‚û¢ Refunds/Chargebacks: Any refunds or chargebacks associated with the order


## **Tools & Technologies**
Excel
Python


## **üéØ Project Objectives**
1. Cost Analysis: Identify major cost components, including direct and indirect costs.
2. Profitability Evaluation: Assess individual and overall profitability by examining commission fees vs. total costs.
3. Strategic Recommendations: Propose strategies to reduce costs and optimize commission/discount rates for improved profitability.
4. Impact Simulation: Forecast the financial impact of recommended strategies and how they could transform losses into profits.

## **üîç Key Insights**
‚û¢ Operations running at a loss: costs (2,32,709.85) exceed revenue (1,26,990), net loss of 1,05,719.85.

‚û¢ Costs are nearly double revenue, negative profit of -1,05,719.85.

‚û¢ Discounts are the major cost (74.9%).

‚û¢ Payment processing fees (12.8%) and delivery fees (12.3%) make up the remaining ~25%.

‚û¢ Profit distribution skewed towards losses; average profit per order is -200 (unprofitable).

‚û¢ Simulation with 30% commission and 6% discount shifts profitability towards positive values.

‚û¢ Recommended rates could increase profitable orders and improve financial health.
